## 🎯 Game Design Document

### Gameplay Loop
1. **Start**: Player sees main menu
2. **Play**: Tap to hop forward across tiles
3. **Obstacles**: Avoid cars, use logs to cross water
4. **Scoring**: Distance traveled = score
5. **Game Over**: Hit obstacle or fall off screen
6. **Restart**: Show score, offer restart/menu options

### Tile Types
- 🟢 **Grass**: Safe starting area
- 🛣️ **Road**: Cars move left/right (avoid)
- 💧 **Water**: Need logs to cross (ride them)
- 🏔️ **Mountain**: Static obstacles to navigate around

### Character Mechanics
- **Movement**: Forward hops only (tap to move)
- **Collision**: Simple rectangle-based collision detection
- **Animation**: Smooth hop animation with particle effects
- **Sound**: Hop sound, obstacle hit, water splash
